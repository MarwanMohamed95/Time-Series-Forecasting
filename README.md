# Time Series Analysis Notebooks

## Overview

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks for time series analysis using different architectures: LSTM+Conv1D and Transformer. These notebooks aim to provide insights into time series forecasting and modeling using deep learning approaches.

## Notebooks

### 1. LSTM+Conv1D Time Series Analysis

#### [Notebook Link](https://github.com/MarwanMohamed95/Time-Series-Forecasting/blob/main/Time_Series_Forecasting_using_sequence_model.ipynb)

This notebook explores time series analysis using a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and 1D Convolutional Neural Network (Conv1D). It covers the following key aspects:

- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing for deep learning models
- Building and training an LSTM+Conv1D model
- Evaluating model performance
- Visualizing predictions and actual values

### 2. Transformer Time Series Analysis

#### [Notebook Link](https://github.com/MarwanMohamed95/Time-Series-Forecasting/blob/main/Time_Series_Forecasting_using_Transformer.ipynb)

This notebook focuses on time series analysis using a Transformer architecture. It covers the following key aspects:

- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing for transformer models
- Building and training a Transformer model
- Evaluating model performance
- Visualizing predictions and actual values

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow (for deep learning models)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (for data manipulation and visualization)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/time-series-analysis.git
   ```

2. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to understand the analysis and run the models.
